# FaceDetection-Tracking_project
👤 Face Recognition System using OpenCV
📌 Description

A Face Recognition System that detects and identifies human faces in real time using OpenCV and pre-trained face recognition models. The system uses a webcam or video stream to recognize known faces by comparing them with previously trained data.

This project demonstrates core computer vision, image processing, and machine learning concepts and is suitable for academic projects, resumes, and entry-level AI roles.

🚀 Features

Real-time face detection using Haar Cascade

Face recognition using trained face encodings

Webcam-based live recognition

Supports multiple faces
