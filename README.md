# FaceDetection-Tracking_project
# 👤 Face Recognition System using OpenCV

## 📌 Description
A Face Recognition System that detects and identifies human faces in real time using OpenCV and pre-trained face recognition models. The system captures faces from a webcam or video stream, compares them with trained data, and displays the identified person’s name.

This project demonstrates core concepts of computer vision, image processing, and machine learning.
